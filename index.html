        What is GitHub?
        GitHub is a hosting platform used by developers to save their code online and track its changes to see what will work when it comes to them working on their projects. GitHub is popular among people in the IT industry due to its easy-to-understand UI and its ability to act as a progress tracker using a Version Control System to track changes. This enables projects to be collaborative. 
        
        There are various reasons why developers prefer using GitHub. They are:
        
        Collaborative Projects: With its existing Version Control System (Git), and the hosting abilities of GitHub on its website, it provides great room for innovation and collaboration among developers to develop collaborative projects.
        Issue Tracker: Any grievances experienced by the developer when they use Git or GitHub can be taken with the tech support team. GitHub has specifically provided an issue tracker to every developer who uses GitHub to communicate the problems they experience while using Git or GitHub.
        Supporting Different Languages: As a code hosting platform, GitHub provides support to a plethora of coding languages and provides support specific to that language. These codes are the base codes used to train GitHub Copilot, an AI-based code generator that autocompletes code with only a few prompts. Some of the languages they provide support to are not limited to C, C++, C#, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, etc.
        Pull Requests: In repositories, developers viewing codes can change any files that may be necessary to optimize the code or fix any errors by utilizing pull requests which directly change the root node in the main repository.
        Hosting Code: GitHub provides a web platform where developers can host various codes for various purposes.
        Open Source Support: GitHub, due to the reasons mentioned above is a great hub for hosting Open Source platform codes and hosting them to commit and update any updates or changes in the platform.
